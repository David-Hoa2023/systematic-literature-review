Executive Summary
AutoResLMA (Automated Research with LLM Agents) is an AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize the scientific research lifecycle. Evolving from the "slr-automation" tool, its purpose is to assist researchers by automating and optimizing tasks from literature review and ideation through to paper development and dissemination. The vision is to create a multi-agent framework where specialized LLM agents collaborate with human researchers, significantly reducing manual effort, enhancing productivity, and accelerating discovery.
For the next 12 months, our primary objectives (OKRs) are:
Objective: Reduce the median time to complete a comprehensive Systematic Literature Review (SLR) by 40% for 100 beta users by Q4 2025.
Key Result 1: Median elapsed hours per SLR using AutoResLMA (Phase 0 & 1 features) ≤ 24 hours (assuming baseline of 40 hours).
Key Result 2: Achieve a user satisfaction score (CSAT) of ≥ 4.0/5.0 for the SLR workflow.
Objective: Enable 50 beta users to successfully generate and refine a novel research idea and a corresponding high-level methodological plan using AutoResLMA (Phase 1 features) by Q1 2026.
Key Result 1: ≥ 70% of users rate the generated ideas and method plans as "helpful" or "very helpful."
Key Result 2: Task completion rate for the "Idea to Method Outline" workflow ≥ 60%.
Objective: Launch a stable MVP encompassing Phase 0 and core Phase 1 features, achieving 200 Monthly Active Users (MAU) within 3 months of public beta release.
Key Result 1: System uptime ≥ 99.5%.
Key Result 2: Average LLM API cost per completed SLR ≤ $5.
The MVP scope will focus on robust SLR automation (Phase 0 enhancements) and the initial implementation of the Literature, Idea, and Method Agents (core Phase 1 features). This PRD outlines the full vision, with features tagged for prioritization to guide phased development.

1. Introduction & Overview
1.1. Project Purpose:
AutoResLMA (Automated Research with LLM Agents) aims to significantly enhance and expand the capabilities of the existing "slr-automation" tool. The goal is to develop a comprehensive, AI-powered platform that assists researchers throughout the entire scientific research lifecycle, from initial ideation and literature review to paper development and dissemination.
1.2. Vision:
To be the leading AI-powered collaborative partner for researchers, transforming the scientific discovery process by making it more efficient, accessible, and innovative.
1.3. Current State:
The foundational "slr-automation" tool currently provides robust capabilities for Systematic Literature Review (SLR) automation. These include research question generation, search string creation for academic databases, fetching and filtering of papers, AI-assisted answer generation for research questions, and the creation of summaries (abstract, introduction, conclusion) with LaTeX output.
1.4. Scope:
This document outlines the requirements for the phased development of AutoResLMA. It details the features, functionalities, user personas, technical considerations, and success metrics for transforming the current SLR tool into a broader, agent-based research assistance system covering the lifecycle stages identified in the "A Vision for Auto Research with LLM Agents" paper. The initial MVP will focus on Phase 0 and core Phase 1 features.
1.5. Glossary: (To be developed)
LLM Agent: A specialized Large Language Model-based system designed to perform specific tasks within the research lifecycle.
Research Lifecycle Stages: The eight interconnected stages (Literature, Idea, Method, Experiment, Paper, Evaluation, Rebuttal, Promotion) as defined in the "AutoResearch Vision."
SLR: Systematic Literature Review.
MVP: Minimum Viable Product.
OKR: Objectives and Key Results.
MoSCoW: Prioritization method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).
NFR: Non-Functional Requirement.
RAID: Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies.

5. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria
Persona: Alex Chen (Novice PhD Student)
User Story (F1.1.1 - SLR Gap Analysis): "As a PhD student new to SLRs, I want the Literature Agent to automatically identify and list potential research gaps with supporting citations after I've completed my initial paper screening, so that I can quickly focus my research direction and justify my study's novelty."
Acceptance Criteria (INVEST-compliant):
Given I have uploaded/selected a set of relevant papers (≥10) for my SLR objective,
And the Literature Agent has processed these papers,
When I request a "Gap Analysis,"
Then the system displays a list of at least 3 (configurable, up to N) distinct research gap statements.
And each gap statement is accompanied by at least one direct quote or synthesized point from the processed literature that supports its identification.
And each gap statement includes references/citations to the paper(s) from which it was derived.
And I can rate the relevance/clarity of each gap statement (e.g., 1-5 stars).
And I can select specific gap statements to feed into the "Idea Agent."
And the process completes within X minutes for Y papers (define performance NFR).
(More user stories for different personas and features would follow, each with acceptance criteria.)

8. Potential Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies (RAID)
(See Appendix D for a detailed RAID Log with owners and mitigation status - Placeholder)
Key Risks (Examples from previous list, to be expanded in RAID log):
R1: LLM Reliability & Hallucination
R2: Ensuring Scientific Rigor
R3: Ethical Considerations
R5: Cost of LLM APIs
New R9: Regulatory / Publisher Policy Shifts (e.g., Elsevier API rate limits, journal policies on AI-assisted writing). Mitigation: Abstract data fetch layers; maintain multiple adapters; monitor policy changes.
New R10: LLM Model Drift (performance changes when vendors update models). Mitigation: Implement automated regression test suite with fixed prompts before deploying new model versions.
